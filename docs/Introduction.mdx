# DocMorris Health App Components

Welcome to the DocMorris Health App component library documentation. This library provides a set of reusable components built with React Native and following SOLID principles.

## Core Principles

Our components are built with these principles in mind:

- **Single Responsibility**: Each component has a single responsibility
- **Open/Closed**: Components are open for extension but closed for modification
- **Liskov Substitution**: Subtypes can be substituted for their base types
- **Interface Segregation**: We prevent clients from depending on interfaces they don't use
- **Dependency Inversion**: We depend on abstractions, not concretions

## Getting Started

```jsx
import { Button } from '@/components/ui/Button';

export default function MyScreen() {
  return (
    <Button variant="primary" onPress={() => console.log('Pressed')}>
      Press Me
    </Button>
  );
}
```

## Component Categories

Our components are organized into the following categories:

- **UI Components**: Basic building blocks (Button, Card, Input, etc.)
- **Scan Components**: Components for scanning health cards and OCR
- **Auth Components**: Components for authentication and verification
- **Navigation**: Components for app navigation
- **Modals**: Overlay and dialog components
